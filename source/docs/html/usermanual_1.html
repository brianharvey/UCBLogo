Source file compatible among Unix, DOS, Windows, and Mac platforms.

Random-access arrays.

Variable number of inputs to user-defined procedures.

Mutators for list structure (dangerous).

Pause on error, and other improvements to error handling.

Comments and continuation lines; formatting is preserved when
procedure definitions are saved or edited.

Terrapin-style tokenization (e.g., [2+3] is a list with one member)
but LCSI-style syntax (no special forms except TO).  The best of
both worlds.

First-class instruction and expression templates (see APPLY).

<h2 class="section"> 1.2 Getter/Setter Variable Syntax </h2>

<p>Logo distinguishes <var>procedures</var> from <var>variables</var>.  A procedure
is a set of instructions to carry out some computation; a variable is a
named container that holds a data value such as a number, word, list, or
array.
</p>
<p>In traditional Logo syntax, a non-numeric word typed without punctuation
represents a request to invoke the procedure named by that word.  A word
typed with a preceding quotation mark represents the word itself.  For
example, in the instruction
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">	PRINT FIRST &quot;WORD
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>the procedures named <code>FIRST</code> and <code>PRINT</code> are invoked, but the
procedure named <var>WORD</var> is not invoked; the word <var>W-O-R-D</var> is the
input to FIRST.
</p>
<p>What about variables?  There are two things one can do with a variable:
give it a value, and find out its value.  To give a variable a value,
Logo provides the primitive procedure <code>MAKE</code>, which requires two
inputs: the name of the variable and the new value to be assigned.  The
first input, the name of the variable, is just a word, and if (as is
almost always the case) the programmer wants to assign a value to a
specific variable whose name is known in advance, that input is quoted,
just as any known specific word would be:
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">	MAKE &quot;MY.VAR FIRST &quot;WORD
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>gives the variable named <code>MY.VAR</code> the value <code>W</code> (the first letter of
<code>WORD</code>).
</p>
<p>To find the value of a variable, Logo provides the primitive procedure
<code>THING</code>, which takes a variable name as its input, and outputs the value
of the accessible variable with that name.  Thus
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">	PRINT THING &quot;MY.VAR
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>will print <code>W</code> (supposing the <code>MAKE</code> above has been done).  Since
finding the value of a specific, known variable name is such a common
operation, Logo also provides an abbreviated notation that combines
<code>THING</code> with quote:
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">	PRINT :MY.VAR
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>The colon (which Logo old-timers pronounce &quot;dots&quot;) replaces <code>THING</code>
and <code>&quot;</code> in the earlier version of the instruction.
</p>
<p>Newcomers to Logo often complain about the need for all this punctuation.
In particular, Logo programmers who learned about dots and quotes without
also learning about <code>THING</code> wonder why an instruction such as
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">	MAKE &quot;NEW.VAR :OLD.VAR
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>uses two different punctuation marks to identify the two variables.
(Having read the paragraphs above, you will understand that actually
both variable names are quoted, but the procedure <code>THING</code> is
invoked to find the value of <code>OLD.VAR</code>, since it's that value, not
<code>OLD.VAR</code>'s name, that <code>MAKE</code> needs to know.  It wouldn't make
sense to ask for <code>THING</code> of <code>NEW.VAR</code>, since we haven't given
<code>NEW.VAR</code> a value yet.)
</p>
<p>Although Logo's punctuation rules make sense once understood, they
do form a barrier to entry for the Logo beginner.  Why, then, couldn't
Logo be designed so that an unpunctuated word would represent a
procedure if there is a procedure by that name, or a variable if
there is a variable by that name?  Then we could say
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">	PRINT MY.VAR
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>and Logo would realize that <code>MY.VAR</code> is the name of a variable, not
of a procedure.  The traditional reason not to use this convention
is that Logo allows the same word to name a procedure and a variable
at the same time.  This is most often important for words that name
data types, as in the following procedure:
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">	TO PLURAL :WORD
	OUTPUT WORD :WORD &quot;S
	END
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Here the name <code>WORD</code> is a natural choice for the input to <code>PLURAL</code>, since
it describes the kind of input that <code>PLURAL</code> expects.  Within the procedure,
we use <code>WORD</code> to represent Logo's primitive procedure that combines two
input words to form a new, longer word; we use <code>:WORD</code> to represent the
variable containing the input, whatever actual word is given when
<code>PLURAL</code> is invoked.
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">	? PRINT PLURAL &quot;COMPUTER
	COMPUTERS
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>However, if a Logo instruction includes an unquoted word that is <strong>not</strong>
the name of a procedure, Logo could look for a variable of that name instead.
This would allow a &quot;punctuationless&quot; Logo, <strong>provided that users who
want to work without colons for variables choose variable names that are not
also procedure names.</strong>
</p>
<p>What about assigning a value to a variable?  Could we do without the
quotation mark on <code>MAKE</code>'s first input?  Alas, no.  Although the
first input to <code>MAKE</code> is <strong>usually</strong> a constant, known
variable name, sometimes it isn't, as in this example:
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">	TO INCREMENT :VAR
	MAKE :VAR (THING :VAR)+1	; Note: it's not &quot;VAR here!
	END

	? MAKE &quot;X 5
	? INCREMENT &quot;X
	? PRINT :X
	6
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>The procedure <code>INCREMENT</code> takes a variable name as its input and
changes the value of that variable.  In this example there are two
variables; the variable whose name is <code>VAR</code>, and whose value is the
word <code>X</code>; and the variable whose name is <code>X</code> and whose value changes
from 5 to 6.  Suppose we changed the behavior of <code>MAKE</code> so that it
took the word after <code>MAKE</code> as the name of the variable to change;
we would be unable to write <code>INCREMENT</code>:
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">	TO INCREMENT :VAR		; nonworking!
	MAKE VAR (THING VAR)+1
	END
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>This would assign a new value to <code>VAR</code>, not to <code>X</code>.
</p>
<p>What we can do is to allow an <strong>alternative</strong> to <code>MAKE</code>, a
&quot;setter&quot; procedure for a particular variable.  The notation will be
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">	? SETFOO 7
	? PRINT FOO
	7
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p><code>SETFOO</code> is a &quot;setter procedure&quot; that takes one input (in this case
the input 7) and assigns its value to the variable named <code>FOO</code>.
</p>
<p>Berkeley Logo allows users to choose either the traditional notation, in
which case the same name can be used both for a procedure and for a
variable, or the getter/setter notation, in which variable <code>FOO</code> is
set with <code>SETFOO</code> and examined with <code>FOO</code>, but the same name
can't be used for procedure and variable.
</p>
<p>Here is how this choice is allowed: Berkeley Logo uses traditional
notation, with procedures distinct from variables.  However, if there is
a variable named <code>AllowGetSet</code> whose value is TRUE (which
there is, by default, when Logo starts up), then if a Logo instruction
refers to a <strong>nonexistent</strong> procedure (so that the error message
&quot;I don't know how to ...&quot; would result), Logo tries the following two
steps:
<a name="IDX1"></a>
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="display">	1.  If the name is at least four characters long, and the first three
	characters are the letters <code>SET</code> (upper or lower case), and if the name
	is followed in the instruction by another value, and if the name
	without the <code>SET</code> is the name of a variable that already exists, then
	Logo will invoke <code>MAKE</code> with its first input being the name without the
	<code>SET</code>, and its second input being the following value.

	2.  If step 1's conditions are not met, but the name is
	the name of an accessible variable, then Logo will invoke
	<code>THING</code> with that name as input, to find the variable's value.
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>Step 1 requires that the variable already exist so that misspellings of names
of <code>SETxxx</code> primitives (e.g., <code>SETHEADING</code>) will still be caught, instead of
silently creating a new variable.  The command <code>GLOBAL</code> can be used to create
a variable without giving it a value.
</p>
<p>One final point:  The <code>TO</code> command in Logo has always been a special
case; the rest of the line starting with <code>TO</code> is not evaluated as
ordinary Logo expressions are.  In particular, the colons used to
mark the names of inputs to the procedure do not cause <code>THING</code> to be
invoked.  They are merely mnemonic aids, reminding the Logo user
that these words are names of variables.  (Arguably, this nonstantard
behavior of <code>TO</code> adds to Logo beginners' confusion about colons.)
To a programmer using colonless variable references, the colons in
the <code>TO</code> line are unnecessary and meaningless.  Berkeley Logo therefore
makes the colons optional:
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">	TO FOO :IN1 :IN2
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>and
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">	TO FOO IN1 IN2
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>are both allowed.

<h2 class="section"> 1.3 Entering and Leaving Logo </h2>


<p>The process to start Logo depends on your operating system:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt> Unix:</dt>
<dd><p>Type the word <tt>logo</tt> to the shell.  (The directory in which you've
installed Logo must be in your path.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt> DOS:</dt>
<dd><p>Change directories to the one containing Logo (probably
<code>C:\UCBLOGO</code>).  Then type <tt>UCBLOGO</tt> for the large memory
version, or <tt>BL</tt> for the 640K version.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> Mac:</dt>
<dd><p>Double-click on the <code>LOGO</code> icon within the &quot;UCB Logo&quot; folder. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt> Windows:</dt>
<dd><p>Double-click on the <code>UCBWLOGO</code> icon in the <code>UCBLOGO</code> folder.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>To leave Logo, enter the command <code>bye</code>.
</p>
<p>On startup, Logo looks for a file named &lsquo;<tt>startup.lg</tt>&rsquo; in the system Logo
library and, if found, loads it.  Then it looks for &lsquo;<tt>startup.lg</tt>&rsquo; in the
user's home directory, or the current directory, depending on the operating
system, and loads that.  These startup files can be used to predefine
procedures, e.g., to provide non-English names for primitive procedures.
</p>
<p>Under Unix, DOS, or Windows, if you include one or more filenames on the
command line when starting Logo, those files will be loaded before the
interpreter starts reading commands from your terminal.  If you load a file
that executes some program that includes a <code>bye</code> command, Logo will run
that program and exit.  You can therefore write standalone programs in Logo
and run them with shell/batch scripts.  To support this technique, Logo does
not print its usual welcoming and parting messages if you give file arguments
to the logo command.
</p>
<p>If a command line argument is just a hyphen, then all command line arguments
after the hyphen are not taken as filenames, but are instead collected in a
list, one word per argument; the buried variable <code>COMMAND.LINE</code> contains
that list of arguments, or the empty list if there are none.  On my Linux
system, if the first line of an executable shell script is
<tt>#!/usr/local/bin/logo -</tt> (note the hyphen) then the script can be given
command line arguments and they all end up in <code>:COMMAND.LINE</code> along with
the script's path.  Experiment.
</p>
<p>If you type your interrupt character (see table below) Logo will stop what
it's doing and return to top-level, as if you did <tt>THROW &quot;TOPLEVEL</tt>.  If
you type your quit character Logo will pause as if you did <code>PAUSE</code>.
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">            wxWidgets      Unix       DOS/Windows     Mac Classic

toplevel      alt-S   usually ctrl-C    ctrl-Q     command-. (period)

pause         alt-P   usually ctrl-\    ctrl-W     command-, (comma)
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>If you have an environment variable called <code>LOGOLIB</code> whose value is the
name of a directory, then Logo will use that directory instead of the default
library.  If you invoke a procedure that has not been defined, Logo first
looks for a file in the current directory named &lsquo;<tt><var>proc</var>.lg</tt>&rsquo; where
<var>proc</var> is the procedure name in lower case letters.  If such a file
exists, Logo loads that file.  If the missing procedure is still undefined, or
if there is no such file, Logo then looks in the library directory for a file
named &lsquo;<tt><var>proc</var></tt>&rsquo; (no &lsquo;<tt>.lg</tt>&rsquo;) and, if it exists, loads it.  If
neither file contains a definition for the procedure, then Logo signals an
error.  Several procedures that are primitive in most versions of Logo are
included in the default library, so if you use a different library you may
want to include some or all of the default library in it.

<p>Names of procedures, variables, and property lists are case-insensitive.  So
are the special words <code>END</code>, <code>TRUE</code>, and <code>FALSE</code>.  Case of

<p>Within square brackets, words are delimited only by spaces and square
brackets.  <code>[2+3]</code> is a list containing one word.  Note, however, that
the Logo primitives that interpret such a list as a Logo instruction or
expression (<code>RUN</code>, <code>IF</code>, etc.) reparse the list as if it had not
been typed inside brackets.
</p>
<p>After a quotation mark outside square brackets, a word is delimited by
a space, a square bracket, or a parenthesis.
</p>
<p>A word not after a quotation mark or inside square brackets is delimited by a
space, a bracket, a parenthesis, or an infix operator <code>+-*/=&lt;&gt;</code>.  Note
that words following colons are in this category.  Note that quote and colon
are not delimiters.  Each infix operator character is a word in itself, except
that the two-character sequences <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, and <code>&lt;&gt;</code> (the
latter meaning not-equal) with no intervening space are recognized as a single
word.
</p>
<p>A word consisting of a question mark followed by a number (e.g., <code>?37</code>),

<p>making the number an input to the ? procedure.  (See the discussion of
templates, below.)  This special treatment does not apply to words read
as data, to words with a non-number following the question mark, or if
the question mark is backslashed.
</p>
<p>A line (an instruction line or one read by <code>READLIST</code> or <code>READWORD</code>)
can be continued onto the following line if its last character is a tilde (<code>~</code>).
<code>READWORD</code> preserves the tilde and the newline; <code>READLIST</code> does not.
</p>
<p>Lines read with <code>READRAWLINE</code> are never continued.
</p>
<p>An instruction line or a line read by <code>READLIST</code> (but not by <code>READWORD</code>)
is automatically continued to the next line, as if ended with a tilde,
if there are unmatched brackets, parentheses, braces, or vertical bars
pending.  However, it's an error if the continuation line contains
only the word <code>END</code>; this is to prevent runaway procedure definitions.
Lines explicitly continued with a tilde avoid this restriction.
</p>
<p>If a line being typed interactively on the keyboard is continued, either
with a tilde or automatically, Logo will display a tilde as a prompt
character for the continuation line.
</p>
<p>A semicolon begins a comment in an instruction line.  Logo ignores
characters from the semicolon to the end of the line.  A tilde as the
last character still indicates a continuation line, but not a continuation
of the comment.  For example, typing the instruction
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">print &quot;abc;comment ~
def
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>will print the word <code>abcdef</code>.  Semicolon has no special meaning in data
lines read by <code>READWORD</code> or <code>READLIST</code>, but such a line can later be reparsed
using <code>RUNPARSE</code> and then comments will be recognized.
</p>
<p>The two-character sequence <code>#!</code> at the beginning of a line also starts a
comment.  Unix users can therefore write a file containing Logo commands,
starting with the line
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">#! /usr/local/bin/logo
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>(or wherever your Logo executable lives) and the file will be executable
directly from the shell.
</p>
<p>To include an otherwise delimiting character (including semicolon or tilde)
in a word, precede it with backslash (<code>\</code>).  If the last character of a line
is a backslash, then the newline character following the backslash will be
part of the last word on the line, and the line continues onto the following
line.  To include a backslash in a word, use <code>\\</code>.  If the combination
backslash-newline is entered at the terminal, Logo will issue a backslash as
a prompt character for the continuation line.  All of this applies to data
lines read with <code>READWORD</code> or <code>READLIST</code> as well as to instruction lines.
</p>
<p>A line read with <code>READRAWLINE</code> has no special quoting mechanism; both
backslash and vertical bar (described below) are just ordinary characters.
</p>
<p>An alternative notation to include otherwise delimiting characters in words
is to enclose a group of characters in vertical bars.  All characters between
vertical bars are treated as if they were letters.  In data read with <code>READWORD</code>
the vertical bars are preserved in the resulting word.  In data read with
<code>READLIST</code> (or resulting from a <code>PARSE</code> or <code>RUNPARSE</code> of a word) the vertical bars
do not appear explicitly; all potentially delimiting characters (including
spaces, brackets, parentheses, and infix operators) appear unmarked, but
tokenized as though they were letters.  Within vertical bars, backslash may
still be used; the only characters that must be backslashed in this context
are backslash and vertical bar themselves.
</p>
<p>Characters entered between vertical bars are forever special, even if the
word or list containing them is later reparsed with <code>PARSE</code> or <code>RUNPARSE</code>.
Characters typed after a backslash are treated somewhat differently:  When a
quoted word containing a backslashed character is runparsed, the backslashed
character loses its special quality and acts thereafter as if typed normally.
This distinction is important only if you are building a Logo expression out
of parts, to be <code>RUN</code> later, and want to use parentheses.  For example,
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">PRINT RUN (SE &quot;\( 2 &quot;+ 3 &quot;\))
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>will print 5, but
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">RUN (SE &quot;MAKE &quot;&quot;|(| 2)
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>will create a variable whose name is open-parenthesis.  (Each example would
fail if vertical bars and backslashes were interchanged.)
</p>
<p>A normally delimiting character entered within vertical bars is <code>EQUALP</code>
to the same character without the vertical bars, but can be distinguished by
the <code>VBARREDP</code> predicate.  (However, <code>VBARREDP</code> returns <code>TRUE</code>
only for characters for which special treatment is necessary: whitespace,
parentheses, brackets, infix operators, backslash, vertical bar, tilde, quote,
question mark, colon, and semicolon.)
