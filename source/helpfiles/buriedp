BURIEDP contentslist
BURIED? contentslist

	outputs TRUE if the first procedure, variable, or property list named
	in the contents list is buried, FALSE if not.  Only the first thing in
	the list is tested; the most common use will be with a word as input,
	naming a procedure, but a contents list is allowed so that you can
	BURIEDP [[] [VARIABLE]] or BURIEDP [[] [] [PROPLIST]].
