READLIST
RL

	reads a line from the read stream (initially the terminal) and
	outputs that line as a list.  The line is separated into members as
	though it were typed in square brackets in an instruction.  If the
	read stream is a file, and the end of file is reached, READLIST
	outputs the empty word (not the empty list).  READLIST processes
	backslash, vertical bar, and tilde characters in the read stream;
	the output list will not contain these characters but they will have
	had their usual effect.  READLIST does not, however, treat semicolon
	as a comment character.
