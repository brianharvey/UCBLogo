EQUALP thing1 thing2
EQUAL? thing1 thing2
thing1 = thing2

	outputs TRUE if the inputs are equal, FALSE otherwise.  Two numbers
	are equal if they have the same numeric value.  Two non-numeric words
	are equal if they contain the same characters in the same order.  If
	there is a variable named CASEIGNOREDP whose value is TRUE, then an
	upper case letter is considered the same as the corresponding lower
	case letter.  (This is the case by default.)  Two lists are equal if
	their members are equal.  An array is only equal to itself; two
	separately created arrays are never equal even if their members are
	equal.  (It is important to be able to know if two expressions have
	the same array as their value because arrays are mutable; if, for
	example, two variables have the same array as their values then
	performing SETITEM on one of them will also change the other.)
