ERROR

	outputs a list describing the error just caught, if any.  If there
	was not an error caught since the last use of ERROR, the empty list
	will be output.  The error list contains four members: an integer
	code corresponding to the type of error, the text of the error
	message, the name of the procedure in which the error occurred, and
	the instruction line on which the error occurred.
