SETMARGINS vector

	command.  The input must be a list of two numbers, as for
	SETCURSOR.  The effect is to clear the screen and then arrange for
	all further printing to be shifted down and to the right according
	to the indicated margins.  Specifically, every time a newline
	character is printed (explicitly or implicitly) Logo will type
	x_margin spaces, and on every invocation of SETCURSOR the margins
	will be added to the input x and y coordinates.  (CURSOR will report
	the cursor position relative to the margins, so that this shift will
	be invisible to Logo programs.)  The purpose of this command is to
	accommodate the display of terminal screens in lecture halls with
	inadequate TV monitors that miss the top and left edges of the
	screen.
