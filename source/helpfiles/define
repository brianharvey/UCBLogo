DEFINE procname text

	command.  Defines a procedure with name "procname" and text "text".
	If there is already a procedure with the same name, the new
	definition replaces the old one.  The text input must be a list
	whose members are lists.  The first member is a list of inputs;
	it looks like a TO line but without the word TO, without the
	procedure name, and without the colons before input names.  In
	other words, the members of this first sublist are words for
	the names of required inputs and lists for the names of optional
	or rest inputs.  The remaining sublists of the text input make
	up the body of the procedure, with one sublist for each instruction
	line of the body.  (There is no END line in the text input.)
	It is an error to redefine a primitive procedure unless the variable
	REDEFP has the value TRUE.
