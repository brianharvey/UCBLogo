SETTEXTCOLOR foreground background
SETTC foreground background

	command (Windows and DOS extended only).  The inputs are color
	numbers, as for turtle graphics.  Future printing to the text window
	will use the specified colors for foreground (the characters
	printed) and background (the space under those characters).  Using
	STANDOUT will revert to the default text window colors.  In the
	DOS extended (ucblogo.exe) version, colors in textscreen mode are
	limited to numbers 0-7, and the coloring applies only to text
	printed by the program, not to the echoing of text typed by the
	user.  Neither limitation applies to the text portion of splitscreen
	mode, which is actually drawn as graphics internally.
