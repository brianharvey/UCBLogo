GLOBAL varname
GLOBAL varnamelist
(GLOBAL varname1 varname2 ...)

	command.  Accepts as inputs one or more words, or a list of
	words.  A global variable is created for each of these words, with
	that word as its name.  The only reason this is necessary is that
	you might want to use the "setter" notation SETXYZ for a variable
	XYZ that does not already have a value; GLOBAL "XYZ makes that legal.
	Note: If there is currently a local variable of the same name, this
	command does *not* make Logo use the global value instead of the
	local one.
