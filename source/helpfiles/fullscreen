FULLSCREEN
FS

	rearranges the size and position of windows to maximize the space
	available in the graphics window.  The details differ among machines.
	Compare SPLITSCREEN and TEXTSCREEN.

	In the DOS version, switching from fullscreen to splitscreen loses
	the part of the picture that's hidden by the text window.  Also,
	since there must be a text window to allow printing (including the
	printing of the Logo prompt), Logo automatically switches from
	fullscreen to splitscreen whenever anything is printed.  [This design
	decision follows from the scarcity of memory, so that the extra memory
	to remember an invisible part of a drawing seems too expensive.]
