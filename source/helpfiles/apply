APPLY template inputlist

	command or operation.  Runs the "template," filling its slots with
	the members of "inputlist."  The number of members in "inputlist"
	must be an acceptable number of slots for "template."  It is
	illegal to apply the primitive TO as a template, but anything else
	is okay.  APPLY outputs what "template" outputs, if anything.
