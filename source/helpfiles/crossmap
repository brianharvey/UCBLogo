CROSSMAP template listlist				(library procedure)
(CROSSMAP template data1 data2 ...)

	outputs a list containing the results of template evaluations.
	Each data list contributes to a slot in the template; the number
	of slots is equal to the number of data list inputs.  As a special
	case, if only one data list input is given, that list is taken as
	a list of data lists, and each of its members contributes values
	to a slot.  CROSSMAP differs from MAP in that instead of taking
	members from the data inputs in parallel, it takes all possible
	combinations of members of data inputs, which need not be the same
	length.

		? show (crossmap [word ?1 ?2] [a b c] [1 2 3 4])
		[a1 a2 a3 a4 b1 b2 b3 b4 c1 c2 c3 c4]
		?

	For compatibility with the version in the first edition of CSLS,
	CROSSMAP templates may use the notation :1 instead of ?1 to indicate
	slots.
