READRAWLINE

	reads a line from the read stream and outputs that line as a word.
	The output is a single word even if the line contains spaces,
	brackets, etc.  If the read stream is a file, and the end of file is
	reached, READRAWLINE outputs the empty list (not the empty word).
	READRAWLINE outputs the exact string of characters as they appear
	in the line, with no special meaning for backslash, vertical bar,
	tilde, or any other formatting characters.
