(EDIT)
(ED)

	command.  If invoked with an input, EDIT writes the definitions
	of the named items into a temporary file and edits that file, using
	your favorite editor as determined by the EDITOR environment
	variable.  If you don't have an EDITOR variable, edits the
	definitions using jove.  If invoked without an input, EDIT edits
	the same file left over from a previous EDIT or EDITFILE instruction.
	When you leave the editor, Logo reads the revised definitions and
	modifies the workspace accordingly.  It is not an error if the
	input includes names for which there is no previous definition.

	If there is a variable LOADNOISILY whose value is TRUE, then, after
	leaving the editor, TO commands in the temporary file print "PROCNAME
	defined" (where PROCNAME is the name of the procedure being defined);
	if LOADNOISILY is FALSE or undefined, TO commands in the file are
	carried out silently.

	If there is an environment variable called TEMP, then Logo uses
	its value as the directory in which to write the temporary file
	used for editing.

	Exceptionally, the EDIT command can be used without its default
	input and without parentheses provided that nothing follows it on
	the instruction line.
