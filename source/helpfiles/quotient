QUOTIENT num1 num2
(QUOTIENT num)
num1 / num2

	outputs the quotient of its inputs.  The quotient of two integers
	is an integer if and only if the dividend is a multiple of the divisor.
	(In other words, QUOTIENT 5 2 is 2.5, not 2, but QUOTIENT 4 2 is
	2, not 2.0 -- it does the right thing.)  With a single input,
	QUOTIENT outputs the reciprocal of the input.
