FULLTEXT procname

	outputs a representation of the procedure "procname" in which
	formatting information is preserved.  If the procedure was defined
	with TO, EDIT, or LOAD, then the output is a list of words.  Each
	word represents one entire line of the definition in the form
	output by READWORD, including extra spaces and continuation lines.
	The last member of the output represents the END line.  If the
	procedure was defined with DEFINE, then the output is a list of
	lists.  If these lists are printed, one per line, the result will
	look like a definition using TO.  Note: the output from FULLTEXT
	is not suitable for use as input to DEFINE!
