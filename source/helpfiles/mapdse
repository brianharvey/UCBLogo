MAP.SE template data					(library procedure)
(MAP.SE template data1 data2 ...)

	outputs a list formed by evaluating the template list repeatedly
	and concatenating the results using SENTENCE.  That is, the
	members of the output are the members of the results of the
	evaluations.  The output list might, therefore, be of a different
	length from that of the data input(s).  (If the result of an
	evaluation is the empty list, it contributes nothing to the final
	output.)  The data inputs may be words or lists.

	In a template, the symbol ?REST represents the portion of the
	data input to the right of the member currently being used as
	the ? slot-filler.  That is, if the data input is [A B C D E]
	and the template is being evaluated with ? replaced by B, then
	?REST would be replaced by [C D E].  If multiple parallel slots
	are used, then (?REST 1) goes with ?1, etc.

	In a template, the symbol # represents the position in the data
	input of the member currently being used as the ? slot-filler.
	That is, if the data input is [A B C D E] and the template is
	being evaluated with ? replaced by B, then # would be replaced
	by 2.
