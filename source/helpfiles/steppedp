STEPPEDP contentslist
STEPPED? contentslist

	outputs TRUE if the first procedure, variable, or property list named
	in the contents list is stepped, FALSE if not.  Only the first thing
	in the list is tested; the most common use will be with a word as
	input, naming a procedure, but a contents list is allowed so that you
	can STEPPEDP [[] [VARIABLE]] or STEPPEDP [[] [] [PROPLIST]].
