MOUSEPOS

	outputs the coordinates of the mouse, provided that it's within the
	graphics window, in turtle coordinates.  If the mouse is outside the
	graphics window, then the last position within the window is returned.
	Exception:  If a mouse button is pressed within the graphics window
	and held while the mouse is dragged outside the window, the mouse's
	position is returned as if the window were big enough to include it.
