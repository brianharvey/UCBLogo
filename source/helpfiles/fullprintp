FULLPRINTP						(variable)

	if TRUE, then words that were created using backslash or vertical bar
	(to include characters that would otherwise not be treated as part of
	a word) are printed with the backslashes or vertical bars shown, so
	that the printed result could be re-read by Logo to produce the same
	value.  If FULLPRINTP is TRUE then the empty word (however it was
	created) prints as ||.  (Otherwise it prints as nothing at all.)
