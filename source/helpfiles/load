LOAD filename

	command.  Reads instructions from the named file and executes
	them.  The file can include procedure definitions with TO, and
	these are accepted even if a procedure by the same name already
	exists.  If the file assigns a list value to a variable named
	STARTUP, then that list is run as an instructionlist after the
	file is loaded.  If there is a variable LOADNOISILY whose value
	is TRUE, then TO commands in the file print "PROCNAME defined"
	(where PROCNAME is the name of the procedure being defined); if
	LOADNOISILY is FALSE or undefined, TO commands in the file are
	carried out silently.
