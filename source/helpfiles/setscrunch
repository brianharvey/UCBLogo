SETSCRUNCH xscale yscale

	adjusts the aspect ratio and scaling of the graphics display.
	After this command is used, all further turtle motion will be
	adjusted by multiplying the horizontal and vertical extent of
	the motion by the two numbers given as inputs.  For example,
	after the instruction "SETSCRUNCH 2 1" motion at a heading of
	45 degrees will move twice as far horizontally as vertically.
	If your squares don't come out square, try this.  (Alternatively,
	you can deliberately misadjust the aspect ratio to draw an ellipse.)

	For Unix machines and Macintoshes, both scale factors are initially 1.
	For DOS machines, the scale factors are initially set according
	to what the hardware claims the aspect ratio is, but the hardware
	sometimes lies.  The values set by SETSCRUNCH are remembered in a
	file (called SCRUNCH.DAT) and are automatically put into effect when
	a Logo session begins.
