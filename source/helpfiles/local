LOCAL varname
LOCAL varnamelist
(LOCAL varname1 varname2 ...)

	command.  Accepts as inputs one or more words, or a list of
	words.  A variable is created for each of these words, with
	that word as its name.  The variables are local to the
	currently running procedure.  Logo variables follow dynamic
	scope rules; a variable that is local to a procedure is
	available to any subprocedure invoked by that procedure.
	The variables created by LOCAL have no initial value; they
	must be assigned a value (e.g., with MAKE) before the procedure
	attempts to read their value.
