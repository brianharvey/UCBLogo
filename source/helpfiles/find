FIND tftemplate data					(library procedure)

	outputs the first constituent of the data input (the first member
	of a list, or the first character of a word) for which the value
	produced by evaluating the template with that consituent in its
	slot is TRUE.  If there is no such constituent, the empty list
	is output.

	In a template, the symbol ?REST represents the portion of the
	data input to the right of the member currently being used as
	the ? slot-filler.  That is, if the data input is [A B C D E]
	and the template is being evaluated with ? replaced by B, then
	?REST would be replaced by [C D E].

	In a template, the symbol # represents the position in the data
	input of the member currently being used as the ? slot-filler.
	That is, if the data input is [A B C D E] and the template is
	being evaluated with ? replaced by B, then # would be replaced
	by 2.
