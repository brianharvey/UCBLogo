TYPE thing
(TYPE thing1 thing2 ...)

	command.  Prints the input or inputs like PRINT, except that no
	newline character is printed at the end and multiple inputs are not
	separated by spaces.  Note: printing to the terminal is ordinarily
	"line buffered"; that is, the characters you print using TYPE will
	not actually appear on the screen until either a newline character
	is printed (for example, by PRINT or SHOW) or Logo tries to read
	from the keyboard (either at the request of your program or after an
	instruction prompt).  This buffering makes the program much faster
	than it would be if each character appeared immediately, and in most
	cases the effect is not disconcerting.  To accommodate programs that
	do a lot of positioned text display using TYPE, Logo will force
	printing whenever SETCURSOR is invoked.  This solves most buffering
	problems.  Still, on occasion you may find it necessary to force the
	buffered characters to be printed explicitly; this can be done using
	the WAIT command.  WAIT 0 will force printing without actually
	waiting.
