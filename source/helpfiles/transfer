TRANSFER endtest template inbasket			(library procedure)

	outputs the result of repeated evaluation of the template.
	The template is evaluated once for each member of the list
	"inbasket."  TRANSFER maintains an "outbasket" that is
	initially the empty list.  After each evaluation of the
	template, the resulting value becomes the new outbasket.

	In the template, the symbol ?IN represents the current member
	from the inbasket; the symbol ?OUT represents the entire
	current outbasket.  Other slot symbols should not be used.

	If the first (endtest) input is an empty list, evaluation
	continues until all inbasket members have been used.  If not,
	the first input must be a predicate expression template, and
	evaluation continues until either that template's value is TRUE
	or the inbasket is used up.
