RERANDOM
(RERANDOM seed)

	command.  Makes the results of RANDOM reproducible.  Ordinarily
	the sequence of random numbers is different each time Logo is
	used.  If you need the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers
	repeatedly, e.g. to debug a program, say RERANDOM before the
	first invocation of RANDOM.  If you need more than one repeatable
	sequence, you can give RERANDOM an integer input; each possible
	input selects a unique sequence of numbers.
