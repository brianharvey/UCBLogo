OR tf1 tf2
(OR tf1 tf2 tf3 ...)

	outputs TRUE if any input is TRUE, otherwise FALSE.  All inputs
	must be TRUE or FALSE.  (Comparison is case-insensitive regardless
	of the value of CASEIGNOREDP.  That is, "true" or "True" or "TRUE"
	are all the same.)  An input can be a list, in which case it is
	taken as an expression to run; that expression must produce a TRUE
	or FALSE value.  List expressions are evaluated from left to right;
	as soon as a TRUE value is found, the remaining inputs are not
	examined.  Example:
		IF OR :X=0 [some.long.computation] [...]
	to avoid the long computation if the first condition is met.
