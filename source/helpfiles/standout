STANDOUT thing

	outputs a word that, when printed, will appear like the input but
	displayed in standout mode (boldface, reverse video, or whatever your
	terminal does for standout).  The word contains terminal-specific
	magic characters at the beginning and end; in between is the printed
	form (as if displayed using TYPE) of the input.  The output is always
	a word, even if the input is of some other type, but it may include
	spaces and other formatting characters.  Note: a word output by
	STANDOUT while Logo is running on one terminal will probably not have
	the desired effect if printed on another type of terminal.

	On the Macintosh, the way that standout works is incompatible with
	the use of characters whose ASCII code is greater than 127.  Therefore,
	you have a choice to make:  The instruction
		CANINVERSE 0
	disables standout, but enables the display of ASCII codes above 127,
	and the instruction
		CANINVERSE 1
	restores the default situation in which standout is enabled and the
	extra graphic characters cannot be printed.
