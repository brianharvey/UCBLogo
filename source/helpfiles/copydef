COPYDEF newname oldname

	command.  Makes "newname" a procedure identical to "oldname".
	The latter may be a primitive.  If "newname" was already defined,
	its previous definition is lost.  If "newname" was already a
	primitive, the redefinition is not permitted unless the variable
	REDEFP has the value TRUE.

	Note: dialects of Logo differ as to the order of inputs to COPYDEF.
	This dialect uses "MAKE order," not "NAME order."
