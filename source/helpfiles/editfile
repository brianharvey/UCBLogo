EDITFILE filename

	command.  Starts the Logo editor, like EDIT, but instead of editing
	a temporary file it edits the file specified by the input.  When you
	leave the editor, Logo reads the revised file, as for EDIT.
	EDITFILE also remembers the filename, so that a subsequent EDIT
	command with no input will re-edit the same file.

	EDITFILE is intended as an alternative to LOAD and SAVE.  You can
	maintain a workspace file yourself, controlling the order in which
	definitions appear, maintaining comments in the file, and so on.
