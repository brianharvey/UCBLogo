SETREADPOS charpos

	command.  Sets the file pointer of the read stream file so that the
	next READLIST, etc., will begin reading at the "charpos"th character
	in the file, counting from 0.  (That is, SETREADPOS 0 will start
	reading from the beginning of the file.)  Meaningless if the read
	stream is the terminal.
