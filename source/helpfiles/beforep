BEFOREP word1 word2
BEFORE? word1 word2

	outputs TRUE if word1 comes before word2 in ASCII collating sequence
	(for words of letters, in alphabetical order).  Case-sensitivity is
	determined by the value of CASEIGNOREDP.  Note that if the inputs are
	numbers, the result may not be the same as with LESSP; for example,
	BEFOREP 3 12 is false because 3 collates after 1.
