FILTER tftemplate data					(library procedure)

	outputs a word or list, depending on the type of the data input,
	containing a subset of the members (for a list) or characters (for
	a word) of the input.  The template is evaluated once for each
	member or character of the data, and it must produce a TRUE or
	FALSE value.  If the value is TRUE, then the corresponding input
	constituent is included in the output.

		?

	In a template, the symbol ?REST represents the portion of the
	data input to the right of the member currently being used as
	the ? slot-filler.  That is, if the data input is [A B C D E]
	and the template is being evaluated with ? replaced by B, then
	?REST would be replaced by [C D E].

	In a template, the symbol # represents the position in the data
	input of the member currently being used as the ? slot-filler.
	That is, if the data input is [A B C D E] and the template is
	being evaluated with ? replaced by B, then # would be replaced
	by 2.
