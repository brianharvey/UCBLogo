SETPALETTE colornumber rgblist

	sets the actual color corresponding to a given number, if allowed by
	the hardware and operating system.  Colornumber must be an integer
	greater than or equal to 8.  (Logo tries to keep the first 8 colors
	constant.)  The second input is a list of three nonnegative integers
	less than 64K (65536) specifying the amount of red, green, and blue in
	the desired color.  The actual color resolution on any screen is
	probably less than 64K, but Logo scales as needed.
