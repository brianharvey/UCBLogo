SETLIBLOC path

	command.  Tells Logo to use the specified directory as its library
	instead of the default.  (Note that many Logo "primitive" procedures
	are actually found in the library, so they may become unavailable if
	your new library does not include them!)  The format of a path depends
	on your operating system.
