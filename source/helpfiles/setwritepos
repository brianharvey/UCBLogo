SETWRITEPOS charpos

	command.  Sets the file pointer of the write stream file so that the
	next PRINT, etc., will begin writing at the "charpos"th character
	in the file, counting from 0.  (That is, SETWRITEPOS 0 will start
	writing from the beginning of the file.)  Meaningless if the write
	stream is the terminal.
