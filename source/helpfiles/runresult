RUNRESULT instructionlist

	runs the instructions in the input; outputs an empty list if
	those instructions produce no output, or a list whose only
	member is the output from running the input instructionlist.
	Useful for inventing command-or-operation control structures:

		local "result
		make "result runresult [something]
		if emptyp :result [stop]
		output first :result
