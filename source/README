This version of Logo is designed for a machine with adequate memory.  It is
not likely to be usable as the basis for a 64K microcomputer implementation.

The interpreter was written primarily by Daniel Van Blerkom, Brian Harvey,
Michael Katz, and Douglas Orleans.  Thanks to Fred Gilham for the X11 code.
Emacs logo-mode by Hrvoje Blazevic.  Send comments by e-mail to

The Unix distribution includes a shell script called "configure" that
customizes Logo for your particular version of Unix.  Just type the name
"./configure" at a shell prompt.  The script performs various tests to see
whether particular libraries, etc., are available.

Logo assumes that you will install it in /usr/local/{bin,lib,info}.  If you
would rather move these subdirectories somewhere else, then instead of saying
"./configure" you should say, e.g.,

	./configure --prefix=/usr

to install into /usr/{bin,lib,info}, or

	./configure --prefix=/home/users/bh

to install into /home/users/bh/{bin,lib,info}.


The configure script writes several files.  The most important are

	makefile		used to compile Logo
	config.h		header file used by C source files

Note: It also writes a file "config.cache" in which it remembers the results
of its tests.  If you copy the Logo source directory to another machine with a
different version of Unix and try to recompile, you should remove config.cache
before running configure.

With these files in place you should be able to say "make" to the shell and
get four results:

	logo			executable Logo interpreter
	logolib			directory with pseudo-primitives in Logo
	helpfiles		directory with online documentation
	emacs			directory with Emacs logo-mode files
				  and documentation in various formats

Alternatively, just say "make logo" if you want to preserve the included
logolib and helpfiles.

The makefile compiles with optimization turned off.  This is necessary to
avoid mysterious garbage collection failures.  (NOTE: On my HP 712, for
reasons I don't understand, I had to compile the entire interpreter without
optimization.  But on other platforms, such as PCs running Linux and FreeBSD,
it's sufficient merely to un-optimize mem.c.  If that works on your machine,
you can remove the "-O0" at the end of the CFLAGS line at the beginning of the
makefile, after running configure.)

The Emacs logo-mode compilation uses gmake.  Some old Linux systems don't have
the name "gmake" defined (although their "make" is actually gmake), but
FreeBSD systems can't handle the makefile for logo-mode without gmake (which
is *not* the same as "make" under FreeBSD).  So you may need to install gmake.

** The files logolib/Messages.* are non-English versions of Messages.
** If you want to translate Logo to another language (see the
** Internationalization section of usermanual), rename Messages to
** Messages.english or something, then rename your chosen one to Messages,
** before make install.

Say "make install" to install files as follows:
	/usr/local/bin:			executable files:
					   logo, install-logo-mode
	/usr/local/lib/logo/logolib:	Logo library procedures,
					Messages (texts of error messages)
	/usr/local/lib/logo/helpfiles:	files printed by Logo's HELP command
	/usr/local/lib/logo/emacs:	elisp files *.el, *.elc for logo-mode,
					Logo-mode tutorial (tutorial.lg),
					an OOP package for Logo (*loops*)
	/usr/local/lib/logo/docs:	usermanual.{ps,pdf,texi}
	/usr/local/lib/logo/docs/html:	usermanual.html and other HTML files
	/usr/local/info:		ucblogo.info (for Emacs help command)

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Each user who wants to use the Emacs logo-mode IDE must first run the shell |
| command "install-logo-mode".  Thereafter, whenever the user opens a Logo    |
| source file (filename.lg) with Emacs, logo-mode will automatically start.   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The files ztc*, mac*, and win32* are for toy-computer versions of Logo.  But
if you are trying to compile for those machines you probably also need some
extra help beyond what's in here.  You can get complete PC and Mac versions by
anonymous FTP from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu.

----------

Here are the special features of this dialect of Logo:

	Random-access arrays.

	Variable number of inputs to user-defined procedures.

	Mutators for list structure (dangerous).

	Pause on error, and other improvements to error handling.

	Comments and continuation lines; formatting is preserved when
	procedure definitions are saved or edited.

	Terrapin-style tokenization (e.g., [2+3] is a list with one member)
	but LCSI-style syntax (no special forms except TO).  The best of
	both worlds.

	First-class instruction and expression templates.

	Macros.
