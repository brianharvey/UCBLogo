Berkeley Logo interpreter

This is a free (both senses) interpreter for the Logo programming language.

This version is 6.0 if you're running wxWidgets, 5.4 if not.  (They are made from the same source code.)

The distribution also includes version 5.3 for frozen platforms DOS and Mac Classic (pre-OS X).

This repo is outdated.  Joshua Cogliati has taken over as chief maintainer; the current version lives at https://github.com/jrincayc/ucblogo-code and is up to version 6.2.4 as of today (9 Feb 25).

There is a 95% finished (but you know what that means) implementation of OOP in the style of Object Logo.

This interpreter is more or less the one from SICP 5.4 (the Explicit Control Evaluator) but with kludges added, mainly because not all Logo procedures return values.

There's one piece of good news:  There's a Program Logic Manual in source/plm.  So all the things I've forgotten aren't lost forever.  :-)
